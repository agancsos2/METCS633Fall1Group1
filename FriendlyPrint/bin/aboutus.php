 Innovative Print Shop, IPS, is an Ohio based print shop company that seeks to
gain a larger share in their business market. Specifically, IPS wishes to build a
customer base in the neighboring states of Indiana and Kentucky. Currently,
IPSâ€™s operations are limited to servicing local customers that visit their store in
person. In order to build a business presence in their desired locations, IPS is
courting the idea of offering their services online. This would allow them to
simply ramp up shop space and resources in Ohio, and obviate their need to
have a physical presence in their target customer locations. Therefore, the IPS
business development team has contracted our software group to develop a
technical solution to facilitate their business expansion effort.
