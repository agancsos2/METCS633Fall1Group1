Innovative Print Shop, IPS, is an Ohio based print shop company that seeks to
gain a larger share in their business market. Specifically, IPS wishes to build a
customer base in the neighboring states of Indiana and Kentucky. Currently,
IPS’s operations are limited to servicing local customers that visit their store in
person. In order to build a business presence in their desired locations, IPS is
courting the idea of offering their services online. This would allow them to
simply ramp up shop space and resources in Ohio, and obviate their need to
have a physical presence in their target customer locations. Therefore, the IPS
business development team has contracted our software group to develop a
technical solution to facilitate their business expansion effort.

To support the business objectives of IPS, our team will develop an online
shopping system, Friendly Print, that will enable IPS to offer their business
products and services online. Friendly print will be rolled out as a website and
will allow existing and new IPS customers to shop the IPS product and service
catalog via the use of a modern internet browser. At the click of mouse,
customers will be able to purchase items such as brochures, business cards,
and posters. In addition, an assortment of printing materials, product sizes,
and inks will be available to ensure that custom print jobs can be fulfilled.
Customers will have the option to either schedule a time to pick-up their
printed materials or to have the items shipped to a location of their choice. As
with most business expansion efforts, the initial set of products and services
offered through the Friendly Print online shopping system will be a small
subset of those that are offered at IPS’s Ohio based print shop. Over the
course of time, Friendly Print will facilitate a full scale offering of IPS products
and services by way of incremental releases.
